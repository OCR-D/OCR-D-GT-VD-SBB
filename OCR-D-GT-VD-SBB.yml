description: >-
  A ground truth (GT) dataset created within the OCR-D project and consisting of
  348 pages extracted from historical documents pertaining to the "Verzeichnis
  der im deutschen Sprachraum erschienenen Drucke" (VD), all of which have been
  digitised by Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Berlin State Library (SBB). The data
  publication consists of 348 .xml files with transcriptions for  348 .tif
  facsimile image files. The image files pertain to 67 distinct works; four
  images were extracted from each of the 65 works; from two further works, 49
  and 39 images respectively were extracted to create the GT. The dataset is
  complemented by a .csv file which contains a mapping between the identifiers
  used in this dataset and the unique identifiers used in the digitised
  collections of Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Berlin State Library, as well as a
  filelisting in .csv format. Data selection was performed within the OCR-D
  project at Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Berlin State Library. The project is
  funded by the German Research Foundation DFG, project grant no. 460675868.
  Ground truth data were established by a digitisation service provider and
  post-corrected by staff members of the Berlin State Library, data curation and
  publication was done by two members of the team of the research project
  "Mensch.Maschine.Kultur – Künstliche Intelligenz für das Digitale Kulturelle
  Erbe" at Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Berlin State Library. The research
  project was funded by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the
  Media (BKM), project grant no. 2522DIG002.
